this week's episode was aiiight.\
first, i like the sort of parallel nature of this series\
Fisk is mayor, but he is still very much involved in the game\
we see a shot of his bloody knuckles (not the first)\
and cut to M.M. washing his own bloody knuckles after the events\
of the last episode. they both are still "stuck in their ways",\
but Fisk is more political, and has pawns that do his bidding for him

i can't say i'm not suprised with how the episode ended\
the trial, which took up most of the episode, was interesting.\
Torres gets scared on the witness stand, and lies to protect himself

i think M.M. is jealous of White Tiger\
i wonder if Hector was dead either way, whether he was convicted or not\
maybe if he would have heeded (headed, head? iykyk) to the advice of M.M.\
things would have gone differently, but of course he chose to be a hero

i'm not really invested in the dealings of Fisk and his men\
i'd rather see him in action, but i know that's not how he operates\
why are his hands bloody though? maybe it's symbolic of the blood of\
Hector, or the two truck drivers at the beginning of the episode

good episode\
M.M. is a terrible attorney
