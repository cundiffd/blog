When I was younger, I played the drums at church.
Every Sunday, I'd get paid five dollars (I think eventually it was 20), 
and I kept track of every dollar I made in my head. 

I gave the money to my parents, but when I asked for it back it was gone!
Just wanted to say I forgive you mom and dad. Miss you.
