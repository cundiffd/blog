i thought about stealing a bus this morning\
the driver got out to use the bathroom\
looked like he kept it running\
and i know where they keep the key

i wonder if it's much different than driving a car\
how fast do buses go?

alas, i'm on the bus now\
the driver is looking at me through the rear view\
like he knows i thought about stealing his bus
