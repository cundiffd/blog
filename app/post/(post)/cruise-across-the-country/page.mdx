In July, I was looking for work in Chicago. I had no money, and went around from 
burger spot to bar, asking the owners if they had any work that they needed help with. 
I talked to Ali, an ex-military tavern owner who initially didn't have any work for me, 
but asked if I would join the Army after I explained my situation to him, to which I 
enthusiastically replied "Yes!". We sat down and he connected me with a contact of his, 
SSG Nicholas Hodges. We talked on the phone for a few minutes and made arrangements to 
meet at the library the following week, and travel to the station afterwards.

After the phone call, leaving the tavern, I turned and asked Ali if he was sure he didn't 
have any work. He told me to come back that weekend and he might have something for me. 
So I did. On Sunday, I returned to the tavern, and stayed for the whole day, moving cases 
of beer, helping the bartenders, running (and dropping!) food to customers. It's funny: at 
the end of that one day, I felt like I was a part of the crew. Before we closed, Ali told 
me he would give me $35 for the work I did since I was not an actual employee (you're kidding). 
Although I was disappointed, I didn't complain. At the end of the night, while I was mopping 
the floors, he handed me $250, and thanked me for the help.

Eating barbecue from the tavern in my car that night, I stumbled across my Washington ID in 
my wallet, and realized how long it had been since I had been home in Seattle. But I was 
supposed to be meeting SSG Hodges the next day, what was I going to do? I decided to follow 
my heart and travel home.

The next morning, I bought a dozen churros, gas, and hit the road. Already, I was down about $50, 
and would have to stretch the remaining $200 over 2000 miles (spoiler alert, I didn't).

I drove through Wisconsin, where I saw my earliest travel memory, Great Wolf Lodge. The 
massive hotel (resort?) and its waterpark reminded me of my childhood, and inspired me to keep going.

I drove through North Dakota, where there was LOTS of land, and hills. The radio station as I 
drove through played mostly classical and country music. I tuned to the former for the most part, 
but vibed with the country music every now and again.

In Montana, I got a ticket, but I also found more work! I stopped by a Domino's, and asked the 
manager if they were hiring. She was very eager to hire me, and I even agreed to come on as a 
(short-term) employee, but after she told me I wouldn't be paid for another week I changed my mind. 
Understanding my situation, she shared with me that she needed some lawn work done, and said if I 
wanted, I could swing by her home while her mother was there and mow the lawn. Of course! 
$50 for more gas secured.

At that time, I was on the border of Montana and Idaho, and Idaho was beautiful! The highway 
carved through so many hills and valleys; I felt like I was in one of those new car commercials, 
with the windows down and my hand cutting through the air. It was so good.

I made it to Washington. People are very open to helping if you're kind and explain to them what 
it is you need. I got free gas at a gas station about 3 hours out, and another $20 from a patron 
who was, coincidentally, also travelling to Seattle! When I made it home, I turned the music off, 
rolled the windows down and took a big deep breath in. The city welcomed me with its cool summer 
breeze, busy highways, and even busier (but friendly) people, and I knew I was home.
