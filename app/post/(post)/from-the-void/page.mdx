Here, in the void.
I'm waiting to be taught.
My pen and paper are ready, at least I think.
It's hard to tell. Here in the void.

Here, in the void, it's pitch black.
The breathing machine doesn't work here.

On my paper, I write fear.
In the void.

In the void, I see my cousin.
Let's play, she says.
In the void.
So much time away.
Scars last for years when you get them here.

With my pen, I write lust.
In the void.

I'm not sure if this game is fun anymore.
I think I hurt my little brother.

Big brother why are you not in the void.
I've lost my voice now calling you.
Abandonment I subconsciously carry on.

I write pain.
In the void.

I hear my momma's voice now.
Here in the void.
"You either inside or outside!"
I laugh, as if I've got a choice.
In the void.
