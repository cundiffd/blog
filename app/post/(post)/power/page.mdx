As I sit in the library, a man across from me is watching something 
on the computer. I don't know what he was watching, but at one point he 
yelled at the computer screen "Shut the f*%$ up!". A security man came 
over to where he was sitting and asked if he was okay. The man said he was.

Several minutes later, the same security man came back over and said to the man, 
"last week, you were here and you threw a computer". The man replied "that 
wasn't me", and the security man said "it was". At this point, tensions were seemingly 
rising and the security man said to the man "I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. That's 
what we do here". The man at the computer lost his composure, and began yelling, calling 
the security man a hunky, and then threw the computer.

### Existential basis
As I sat not even 3 feet away from the situation, the security man's accusation 
seemed more like a disturbance to me. He could have stopped his rambling at "last week"! 
I mean TECHNICALLY, the man at the computer was right, even if he threw a computer last week, 
that wasn't *him* last week, you know?

Master Oogway once said "Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Right now is 
a gift, which is why it is called *the present*".
