"Peace Family" is what I told Percy as I walked down the steps with my food, on the way to catch the bus.
He replied, "Take care of yourself".

"Thanks, you too", I said.

Today was a bad day.

I guess I didn't listen well because at the bus stop, I saw a lady with a sign that said "Hungry".
Two meals and a baguette was more than enough food for me. I just read How to Eat to Live too, and am 
surely experiencing the sickness the Hon. Elijah Mohammed warns of (eat one meal a day).

Can I be real? Food is my only vice.

Anyway, I offered the lady my baguette, and maybe I should have offered my meals, but she refused.
I felt weird, and may have been out of place when I said "You said you were hungry". Right away, I 
heard Percy's voice in my head: Take care of yourself.

People don't just be talking to talk.

I told her to have a good day, got on the bus, and went to the library. There, I suffered for hours, 
trying to deploy Spatial's website. A classic case of "it's working on my PC", because it is! I told 
ChatGPT that I quit, and it wished me "the best of luck with whatever you do next". I was serious, too.

I'm a quitter.

Dinner is at 5, and the guy behind the counter took a jab at me when I asked if the food had pork in it. 
He asked "You don't like pork?". This is clearly a trick question, because in my past life I'd fuck up 
some of my grandma's ribs, but I'm different now. Now, I just say "No pork for me". He asks why, and I 
have an answer this time. It feels good to have an answer. I told him pork isn't good for you, to which 
he replied "yes it is", with a smug look on his face. I didn't eat.

So today was a bad day. More water, harmony mudra, less food.
