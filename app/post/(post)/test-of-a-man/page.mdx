The test of a man\
Is the fight that He makes\
The grit that He daily shows\
The way that he stands upon his feet\
And takes life's numerous bumps and blows

The coward can smile while there's naught to fear\
And nothing his progress bars.\
But it takes a man to stand and cheer\
While the other fellow stars

It isn't the victory after all\
But the fight that a brother makes\
A man, when driven against the wall,\
Still stands erect and takes the blows of fate

With his head held high, bleeding bruised, and pale\
Is the man who will win, and fate defied\
For he isn't afraid to fail
