if the sound of your voice\
has not vibrated my ear drums\
or the warmth of your skin\
set my soul on fire

if the smell of your fragrance\
has not visited my nostrils\
just to say hello\
in months, years

if these eyes know of you\
no more\
and the taste of your lips\
is foreign to me

then leave me alone\
as i've gotten used to you\
or rather the absence of you\
why do you torture me?
