Computation often executes and forgets. Biology endures. 

Temporal ECS Neural Dynamics model computation as a continuous, adaptive process.\
Time is the medium in which structure and learning coexist.  

The architecture separates responsibilities into three layers:

1. **Compute** — orchestrates and executes work in parallel.  
2. **Simulation** — defines entities, components, and systems. 
3. **Neural Dynamics** — integrates experience and adapts behavior continuously.  

---

## 1. Compute — parallel execution

Compute manages **parallel execution of jobs**, including neuron updates.

- **Parallelism:** Large workloads update simultaneously.  
- **Dependency resolution:** Jobs execute only when prerequisites are satisfied.  

Compute enables scalability, supporting large neural populations.

---

## 2. Simulation — structure and persistence

Simulation defines *what exists*. Entities, components, and groups provide stable, contiguous state.  

- **Persistent memory:** Components maintain state across cycles.  
- **Pure transformations:** Systems evolve state; scheduling is external.  
- **Temporal continuity:** State accumulates and decays naturally.  

Simulation is the body of the system.

## 3. Neural Dynamics — continuous adaptation

Neural dynamics define *how the system adapts*, inhabiting the simulation and acting on its state.\
Neurons and synapses exist as components within the ECS.  

- **Temporal integration:** Potentials evolve continuously with inputs, decay, and feedback.  
- **Plasticity:** Synapses adapt dynamically, encoding memory and learning.  
- **Perception-action coupling:** Neural outputs modify ECS state.  
- **Parallel updates:** Compute executes neuron updates in parallel, enabling scale.

## 4. Unified temporal flow

The system operates as a continuous loop:

1. Data is streamed into the system through a network.
2. Simulation evolves component states.  
3. Neural dynamics integrate inputs and produce outputs.  

---

## 5. Computation that endures

Temporal ECS Neural Dynamics transforms computation into a living substrate:

- **Compute** provides scalable, parallel execution.  
- **Simulation** provides persistent form and structure.  
- **Neural dynamics** provide adaptation and memory.  

Signals propagate. Potentials integrate. Behavior emerges. Computation remembers, adapts, and persists.
