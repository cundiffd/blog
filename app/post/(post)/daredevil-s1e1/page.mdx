Foggy's death was very unexpected.\
the action scene that followed (with almost no cuts) with Matt and Poindexter (what's his villain name?)\
was chilling.

when Foggy dies, you realize that his heartbeat was in the background of the entire scene.\
matt (Daredevil) gets sliced like a turkey on thanksgiving but is still alive. as far as i know\
he cannot heal.

i don't know what it is, but i feel like villains need a motive. if they don't have one, \
it seems kind of corny, as was the case here. the guy was killing everybody just for the sake\
... of ... killing... everybody? i don't know. Kingpin called him "Dex", so maybe the two \
were working together in some way.

the date scene was so "human". i thought they did a terrific job of\
portraying the awkward, guarded feelings of the two. it was a conversation where if you watched,\
you didn't really have moments like "What?", "Why?", it was more like you just sat there with a\
face, like "ehhh?". they both put their identities aside and tried talking as people, and the\
sound fades out and it's just magic. i'm blanking on her name. let's call her the therapist.

Kingpin is mayor of NY, if I recall correctly he was last being locked up after (literally) beating\
M.M.'s head in. but DC's daredevil was a while ago. it was interesting to see them talking casually\
over coffee.
