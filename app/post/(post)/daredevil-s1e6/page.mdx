I was excited to find out that we got 2 episodes this week.\
And episode 6 was a banger.

I'd like to start by saying that I was very upset that Muse got\
away. We learned in this episode that his grafitti across the city\
is done using the blood of his victims. We're shown some really gruesome\
murders, and after watching him capture and attempt to kill Angela Ayala,\
niece of Hector Ayala (White Tiger), I thought we deserved some... idk..\
justice?

Anyway, a lot more happened this episode. Both M.M. and Wilson Fisk tap\
back into their old ways, Fisk freeing Adam just to beat him close to death\
and throw him back in, and Murdock suiting back up to track down Muse and\
save Angela.

Also, Muse has killed 60+ people, SIXTY.

Again, I was very upset that he got away.

Fisk is also putting together a "gang" of cops to track down vigilantes after\
learning about Muse. This group will work overtime with no body cams or anything,\
and it seems like a way for him to build an army of corrupt policemen. He's called\
"old man", and is told to stay out of the game, which might have provoked his actions\
later in the episode, feeling like he had to prove, maybe to himself, that he still had\
it in him.

We found out that Matthew prays every morning, with a picture of Foggy, and we get\
a couple of flashbacks as well, one of the opening scene of this season, which again\
was amazing. We see some more flashbacks, like last episode's fight scene in the stairwell\
and his conversation with Fisk. It shows us that he's seriously haunted by his mind, that \
can't seem to let go of his past.

Fisk has dropped 2 quotes now this season that have stuck with me, and I'm starting to like\
the guy.
