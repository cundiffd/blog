Isn't it beautiful?

How we move through this thing called life, each day living and 
dying and living again. The yin and yang of it all, the Kala and Zima.

It fascinates me how this is even reflected in nature. Insects and 
other creatures like snakes and butterflies, shedding layers, 
constantly evolving. Isn't it beautiful how we are all so connected 
to this one truth, yet it seems so taboo?

The trees lose their leaves in the fall, only to restore them 
again in the spring. Breathing. One big breath out, another big 
breath in. Isn't it beautiful?

Death, we dare not speak its name, holding so much weight and 
negative attachment but only signifying a return to what is!
It's truly remarkable. Hearts beat and they pause, eyes close 
and they open again, it's so natural.

It's so beautiful, right?
