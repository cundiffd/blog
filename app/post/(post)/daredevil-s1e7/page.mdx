This week's episode of Daredevil: Born Again was very eventful.\
Heather acts as a therapist to Matt (and he jokingly calls her doctor)\
when she questions his whereabouts and the source of his bruises.\
I could not date a therapist, I'll be the first to say, because Matt's\
feable attempt at lying to her seemed so pointless to me. Like bro, she's\
a wizard.

One of Fisk's men meets with Vanessa and tries to recruit her to take down\
her husband? Are you serious? My view may be influenced by my extreme\
loyalty (seriously, I was chosen for the house of Hufflepuff in Hogwarts),\
but I saw the ending coming from a mile away, although my foresight didn't\
take away from how player the scene was. Fisk is unphased as Buck kills\
guy whose name I don't know from the shadows with a silenced pistol.

Muse is revealed to be Bastion Cooper, a seemingly troubled man who is actually\
seeing Heather, the therapist and Matt's girlfriend, so that's nice.\
I didn't understand why immediately after Bastion says "I know there's only one\
things you're thinking, can I make it to the door in time", Heather immediately runs\
to the door? Kinda 0 IQ, definitely the wrong answer but I digress. "Daredevil"\
jumps through the window as soon as Muse is about to kill Heather, they fight for a bit\
and Heather fires 4 (?) shots at Muse, killing him. You can tell she's playing no games\
because you hear several "click" sounds as she tries to fire more rounds of an empty gun.

Fisk covers the ordeal up, saying that NYPD took care of Muse, but that's political\
and boring.

Really solid episode. 8.6/10.
