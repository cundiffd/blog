I met with a case manager this morning.\
We had agreed to meet at 7, but he wrote down 7:15 and left me a note\
"reminding" me that we were meeting at this time.

So I met with him today.\
I knocked on his door at 7:11, and he said come in.\
He thanked me for meeting with him, then asked if I had made a decision about work.\
Two weeks ago he told me "this isn't a place to start a business", but I was unaware I\
had a decision to make, so I told him and he decided to "refresh me on our last meeting",\
and went on that I was either finding a source of income or working on my own 2 endeavors,\
my writings and Spatial.

Still unaware that I had to choose, I shared that I secured an interview today.\
His response was "In two weeks you got one interview?"\
Bus is coming, and I'm heading there now. Here are my notes from our meeting:

David Whitworth: "In 2 weeks we have one interview?"\
David wants to meet with me and his boss\
David: doesn't feel this is the right place for me.\
David: feels it is difficult dealing with me\
David: wants to let his boss talk with me.\
David: to leave a note on my bed scheduling a meeting with Tim, his boss

I wrote back that I would not be able to meet physically.\
I wrote my email and offered to meet via Spatial, or reschedule for \
a time before 7:30. No response back for the week, until I came back to another\
note on Friday:

Hi Dakari,

You will meet with the case management team on Monday at 11:00 am.\
If you do not come to this meeting, we will assume that you no longer want to be part of this program and will take it as a self exit.

Thank you\
Tim Walker\
Supervisor of the LINK program

David, Tim,

This is a program? I thought I was staying at a hotel! Don't worry, I will be gone Monday morning.

Peace and love,\
Dakari T. C.

I left David an apple with my note.
