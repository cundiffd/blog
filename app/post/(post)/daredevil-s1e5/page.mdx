Daredevil: Born Again S1E5 was a cool filler episode.\
We spend the entire episode with Yusef Khan, who is the\
father of another hero in the MCU, Kamala Khan (or Ms. Marvel).\
He is a huge fanboy (as all dads should be), and has her on his desk.

Mr. Khan is an assistant bank manager, in charge while the bank\
manager himself is out on errand. Matt Murdock is meeting with him\
because his law firm is in need of cash flow. They aren't profitable.

The bank is intruded by masked robbers with colored masks.\
It's ironic that in the city, it's Saint Patrick's Day, and the \
robbers are Irish. I'm not sure if they work for a boss or they just\
thought the day was fitting for a bank robbery, but they're after a \
really nice, really big diamond that's later revealed to be in one of\
the safety deposit boxes.

I think Mr. Khan could have found the box sooner. He mentioned that he could\
see the number 4 on the key, but was checking boxes like 383 (?). That \
didn't make much sense.

Eventually, they find the box, M.M. stalls the robbers until the cops eventually\
show up, and uses the red mask he picked off of one of the robbers (because he's Daredevil)\
to track down the head huncho in the green mask, who snuck off as a cop under cover.

Like I said, it was moreso of a filler episode, which I think was a cool way\
to connect more heroes. We got a mention of Spiderman earlier in the season,\
and now Kamala Khan.
