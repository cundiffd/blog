The day slips by before my eyes  
like a flame that flickers out—  
I wake, but the world has moved  
too far ahead, leaving me behind  
in the silence of its wake.

But I remember you,  
dancing in a room I never saw,  
grace and effort woven into every move.  
I can still hear the rhythm of your steps,  
feel the air shift as you glide,  
perfect in every sway,  
a thousand hours practiced,  
a thousand dreams made real.

You were the Phoenix,  
rising, not from ashes,  
but from the purity of your own fire.  
And I, drawn too close,  
breathe in the flames you pour into me,  
warming the cold of my bones.

But it’s a dance, a balance—  
too much and I risk burning,  
too little and I freeze in the dark.  
Yet still, I step closer,  
and this time, I hope for the flames  
to consume me completely,  
to turn me to ash,  
to make me whole in your fire,  
knowing that the burn is both the end  
and the beginning,  
and I would let it happen.
