i smell\
incense burning in my apartment\
as ritual, meditation\
i run to you\
backwoods and french toast\
i'm on the road now\
wife sits in the passenger seat\
it's so bright in here\
dogs hang their torsos out of the window\
sun and daughter are on the roof of this very fast car\
i realize\
my hands aren't on the wheel and it's okay\
because we're flying\
i'm at home now\
making tacos and guacamole\
two bottles of ortega\
six bottles of tequila\
eucalyptus showers\
my plants are growing\
my hair is long\
my nails are long\
my dick is long\
life is good\
and i wish i had a wife\
and dogs\
and kids
