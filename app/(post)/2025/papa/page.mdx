Babu,

I apologize for our last encounter\
I didn't intend for you to feel like I was pressing you for money\
but i understand if you did

you prefaced my visit to your home\
as a work opportunity, and we shook on it

thank you\
i earned that day a trip across the world\
for better or for worse

manic depression played at KEXP this morning\
where the music matters
