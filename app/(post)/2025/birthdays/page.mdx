I guess I've been celebrating my birthday for 3 weeks now.\
It's time to come down now.

My Dad sent me 26 big ones and I spent it on a gym membership and ETH.\
The billing period resets on the 17th though so yesterday was my last day.\
Next time: Join on the first day of the billing period.

Dakarai out.
