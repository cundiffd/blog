so if you sometimes knock\
and i don't answer\
and there isn't a woman in here\
maybe i have broken my jaw\
and am looking for wire\
or i am chasing the butterflies in\
my wallpaper,\
i mean if i don't answer\
i don't answer, and the reason is\
that i am not yet ready to kill you\
or love you, or even accept you,\
it means that i don't want to talk\
i am busy, i am mad, i am glad\
or maybe i'm stringing up a rope;\
so even if the lights are on\
and you hear sound\
like breathing or praying or singing\
a radio or the roll of dice\
or typing —\
go away, it is not the day\
the night, the hour;\
it is not the ignorance of impoliteness,\
i wish to hurt nothing, not even a bug\
but sometimes i gather evidence of a kind\
that takes some sorting\
...\
and your hair, if you have some,\
or your mind — they cannot enter\
until the rope is cut or knotted\
or until i have shaven into\
new mirrors, until the world is\
stopped or opened\
forever
