this is usually the part of the game where i start over\
i realize this character is no good\
think about what i would do differently\
how perfect my new character will be

this is usually that part of the game\
where i vow to do it right this time\
move to a new place and finally start life\

this is that part\
where i leave it all behind, because\
what's new will be far greater\
than this part
