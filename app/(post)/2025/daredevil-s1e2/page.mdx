THE CASE IS RUINED

aside from the beginning (when does a subway scene NOT end in someone \
dying to an "unexpected" train?), this episode was pretty uneventful, besides some key parts\
namely:

fisk blackmails the commisioner with a photo of \
what looked to be his kid and wife at D'Angelo's, a cheesesteak restaurant

M.M. and associate discuss whether or not Hector (white tiger) is guilty \
in a scene that strangely resembles the conversation between Peter Parker and \
Harry Osborn in The Amazing Spider-man 2. M.M. even picks up a rock and throws it\
out into the water, just like Peter did.

Hector is revealed to be White Tiger, and the judge grants a motion that prevents\
any evidence of this alias from being used in court. this is big, but after the end\
of the episode, i'm not sure if it will mean much. M.M., being mugged by cops, is\
left to either die or tap into Daredevil, who he was trying to leave behind.

Fisk and his wife, Vanessa, begin therapy with Heather, M.M.'s girlfriend\
which is super interesting.

we also get a reference to "men in spider suits" from Kingpin, so that's cool.
