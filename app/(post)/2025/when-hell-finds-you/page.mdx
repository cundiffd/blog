For years.

10 years, no 20. I thought I found you.
But if only you knew.

For 20 years, I knew you, but you knew me too.
That Hell finds you. 

In contrast, short temper, time finds you alone.
With noone to run to, just you and your soul.
Hell Finds You.

Alone. What's real, but only what you can see.
No more trusting what's in your head, aren't you tired?
That Hell Finds You. Is something that you've always known.
But maybe you only can't admit.
That Hell Found you.

But why you? Only you, it feels.
In short time, record time, it's real.
You know that 

*Free association is a writing technique in which you suspend thought, 
and write without pause. In time, you find you write that which you 
may not have even known to be within. In a way, you are free from 
association with what you are writing, but in other ways, you are 
more associated than ever.*
