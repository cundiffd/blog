I feel asleep watching this episode.\
Then I watched it again.

I have some newfound suspicion for Heather. It seems like\
she's playing the "oblivious" girlfriend who actually turns\
out to be a villain. What if her therapy sessions with the Fisks\
are really them discussing business in code?

I liked the song at the end, and can somebody kill officer Powell?
