I sat across from a man on the bus today.
He asked me where I was from.
Like usualy, I replied "from here". I don't know why I always say that.
I guess it's just easier, since when I tell people where I'm really from (The Region),
their next immediate question is "What brought you here?", and I've tried many different variants 
of answers to that question: work, opportunity, love (this usually gets back a "that's good"), 
but I can't help but think anyone who asks that question already knows that I have no clue.

This man on the bus was dressed in Falcons gear, had a whiteclaw in-hand, and told me his 
birthday was Monday. He was 62. He then went on rambling about the Temptations and all 
I could pull from what he was saying was that he was David Ruffin. He told me that he didn't 
want his grandkids to know where he was. It didn't feel like he meant right in that moment, 
but more like in the grand scope of things. I guess taking time off from those you love is 
not just a me thing.

I asked him if he watched the Super Bowl, and he said no because who watches the Super Bowl 
anymore. He offered a handshake with two fingers, peace, as I had greeted him when I got on the bus, 
and made a friend.

But when he got off the bus, he told me he loved me LOL. I love you too, David.
