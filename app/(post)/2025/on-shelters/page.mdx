For 66 days, I have lived at a men's shelter. Here they have\
different programs available. For temporary shelter there is an ES2 program\
or enhanced shelter program, in which they allow you to occupy a bed for 30\
days. They provide you with a shower and hygiene supplies, and they serve\
breakfast every morning at 7:30, which could be oatmeal, cereal, donuts, \
pancakes, or any combination of the former.

With no plans for shelter as the end of my 30 days grew nearer, I asked the case\
manager to place me on the list for their LINK program, which is a longer term program.\
Aside from the times I consented to a urine sample, this was the first time I talked to\
the case manager. I got a piece of paper on my bed a couple of days before my 30 days\
were up that read "PLEASE SEE THE FRONT DESK TO ENTER THE LINK PROGRAM".

I've been here now, in the LINK program, for 30 days. The first case manager I was assigned\
gave me a tour and explained the rules. There are 3 meals a day served for guests of this \
program, and a mandatory devotion for those whose schedule allows. We planned to meet again the next\
morning, but when I got back from work, there was a note for me saying he couldn't make it and that\
he'd see me next week. The order of our notes was like (CM = case manager, DC = me):

- CM: "Can't make our meeting. See you next week."
- CM: "Move stuff to 3rd floor bed \#305. Meet w/ new case manager."
- DC: "I'm not sure why I was instructed to move, but I've developed a routine and feel it would be disrupted."
- CM: "You're good to stay put 4 now. Let's meet Wednesday at 4"

My grandmother told me before that when you are growing plants, you should cut their roots\
every so often, so as to encourage further growth.

We meet that Wednesday and he tells me that the note was not punishment but progress.\
A week later he leaves another note that says "It's time to progress". It appears that here\
progress is measured by the floor that you sleep on. During our next meeting (we met twice),\
in which I was "handed off" to the staff of floor 3, one of the men said I was "moving on up".\
I've been on the 3rd floor now for two weeks. Sometimes it feels like life says to me \
"You don't have to do it on your own" and at the same time "Don't call me!".

I heard someone on the bus today say "I'll never leave Seattle", as if he has a choice.\
