A man and father stand separated by a deep chasm.
The man, lost in debt, goes to the father with a list of what he owes.

Pick one thing you would like help with, says the father.
The man and the father now hold a rope.

The man, having concluded that a phone would serve him well, decides to tackle this debt first.
I'd like to pay off my phone bill, two thousand dollars, says the man.

The man tugs at the rope.

The father denies, the man's request is not within his budget.
The father tugs at the rope.

The man thinks again.
I will sell my car, says the man, for one thousand dollars.

The man tugs at the rope.
The father tugs, again.

One thousand dollars? Says the father.
You would be better off selling the car to me. I will pay twenty five hundred dollars.

The man says nothing.
He drops the rope.

And so he wins.
