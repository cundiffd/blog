Tonight, I find myself in a donut shop, surrounded by the comfort of warm drinks and familiar faces. But it’s not that simple. 
There’s a dissonance between the warmth this place promises and the cold feeling of uncertainty I carry. As 
*I Call Your Name* by Switch plays softly in my ears, I feel the weight of the lyrics, and in some way, they echo the tension 
inside me — longing for connection, yet feeling disconnected.

I turn to my work, trying to stay grounded, trying to find purpose in the midst of all this discomfort. It’s not an 
escape — it’s just a way to keep moving, to hold onto something real when everything else feels like it’s slipping. There’s 
a quiet strength in pushing forward, even when you’re not sure where you’re going. But I know this: resilience isn’t about 
pretending the discomfort doesn’t exist. It’s about learning how to carry both the hope and the hardship together.

This journey isn’t linear. It’s messy, sometimes contradictory, and often full of moments when you feel stuck. But each 
step — no matter how small — matters. I’m moving forward, even if it’s just one quiet step at a time.
